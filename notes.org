** [2023-01-21 Сб 15:30] just copying the pointer of the structure that is already been allocated in nested function
  return s;

[[file:~/repo/fluentC/lifetime-ownership/driver.c::return s;]]
** [2023-01-12 Чт 14:19] I think it means that everyone who includes this header file are holding access to that "global" structure
/* file-global array holding all registry keys */
static struct Key* key_list[MAX_KEYS];

[[file:~/repo/fluent-c/returning-errors/registry.c::/* file-global array holding all registry keys */
static struct Key* key_list\[MAX_KEYS\];]]

also it makes the key available for being read(by other functions that are not part of this code example)
